JavaScript lodash Templates Lab
---

## Objectives

1. Practice using JavaScript templates for a simple blog
2. Practice modularizing code and templates
3. Practice separating view and logic concerns

## Introduction

- Students should create a simple blogging platform (again, no need for a server)

- We'll want to test a few templates:
  - Page (this contains an entire blog post, including, e.g., a sidebar)
  - Post (this contains the blog post itself)
  - Comments (this is a container for individual comments)
  - Comment (this is one comment)

- Commenting should work, so we'll want to test that too

## Resources

- [npm](https://npmjs.org)
